# Reason-Graphql-Hooks-NextJS

This is a NextJS based template with following setup:

- Based on [ryyppy/nextjs-default](https://github.com/ryyppy/nextjs-default)
- Full Tailwind config & basic css scaffold (+ production setup w/ purge-css & cssnano)
- Reason + ReasonReact
- Basic Reason Bindings for Next
- Preconfigured Dependencies: `reason-graphql-hooks`, `reason-react`, `bs-fetch`, `@glennsl/bs-json`

## Development

Run BuckleScript in dev mode:

```
yarn run bs:start
```

In another tab, run the Next dev server:

```
yarn run dev
```

## Useful commands

Build CSS seperately via `postcss` (useful for debugging)

```
# Devmode
postcss styles/main.css -o test.css

# Production
NODE_ENV=production postcss styles/main.css -o test.css
```

## Test production setup with Next

```
# Make sure to uncomment the `target` attribute in `now.json` first, before you run this:
yarn build
PORT=3001 yarn start
```
